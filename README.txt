Create a class called Topher_Count_Posts. inside that class create a method called validate_date and use date_parse and checkdate.  Make validate_date return either false or a date formatted like YYYY-MM-DD.

Make another method called count_posts. Check for existence and not empty of two GET variables, _GET['d1'] and _GET['d2'].  If they don't exist, return.  Use validate_date to validate both variables.  if they don't validate, return.

If both variables validate, use WP_Query to count the number of posts between and including the two date variables. 

Echo the number and then exit.
